3. **Edit / Delete** for transactions, bills, subscriptions
4. **Pay Now** on bills
5. **Manage** on subscriptions
6. **Date range filter** on dashboard
7. **Revenue change %** calculation
8. **Pricing page CTAs** (free trial, upgrade, contact sales)
9. **Google SSO** on login
10. **Real integration connectors** (BCA, Stripe, Meta Ads)
