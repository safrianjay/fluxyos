# FluxyOS Roadmap

Tracks what's shipped, what's stubbed (UI exists, no logic), and what's planned.

---

## Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Shipped | Fully working, live on main |
| 🔧 Stub | UI/button exists but has no working logic yet |
| 📋 Planned | Not yet built |

---

## Core App Features

### Authentication
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Email/password login via Firebase Auth | ✅ Shipped | |
| Auth guard on all dashboard pages (redirect to `/login`) | ✅ Shipped | 2s timeout |
| Sign out | ✅ Shipped | Sidebar button |
| User display name + avatar in sidebar | ✅ Shipped | |
| Google SSO login | 🔧 Stub | Button exists on login page, no OAuth handler |

### Onboarding (new-user-only)
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 4-step setup flow on `/onboarding` | ✅ Shipped | Business setup → Account owner → Finance setup → Review |
| New-user detection via `ONBOARDING_RELEASE_CUTOFF = 2026-05-19T00:00:00.000Z` | ✅ Shipped | Users created before cutoff are exempt. Self-heals stale `legacy_exemption` markers if the cutoff is moved back. |
| Dashboard gate on app pages for incomplete new users | ✅ Shipped | Contextual copy per page; no impact on legacy users |
| Post-KYC platform learning | ✅ Shipped | Overview quick-start cards plus coachmark tours after completed setup only |
| Optional identity / business document upload | 🔧 Stub | UI present, no Firebase Storage upload yet; status always `not_uploaded` |
| Sample-data mode after onboarding | 📋 Planned | "Explore sample data" routes to dashboard without seeding records |
| "Use sample data" CTA on the dashboard gate | 📋 Planned | Hidden in v1 |

### Internal Operations Console (internal-only)
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Internal console page `internal.html` (Overview, Users, KYC, Payment, Audit tabs) | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Reuses dashboard design system; no footer/sidebar; hidden from public nav + sitemap |
| Credential gate (`fluxyos admin`, sessionStorage) | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | `MVP_INTERNAL_ONLY_TEMPORARY_AUTH` — not production-grade; replace with Firebase custom claims / backend admin session |
| `internal_users` index + self-upsert on login/onboarding | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | `DataService.syncSelfToInternalIndex`; covers only users who sign in after release |
| KYC / payment / account status actions + `internal_audit_logs` | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Confirmation dialogs, reviewer notes, audit log per action |
| Open `internal_*` firestore.rules (field-validated) | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Must be **deployed** for the console to load data. Open by design until admin auth exists |
| Auth deletion cleanup for `internal_users/{uid}` | 🚧 Ready to deploy | 1st-gen Firebase Auth trigger is implemented; production deploy is blocked until the Firebase project is upgraded from Spark to Blaze |
| User-scoped audit mirror (`users/{uid}/audit_logs`) | 📋 Planned | Needs backend/Admin SDK (console is unauthenticated) |
| Legacy customer proof upload + `payment_verifications` | 🧊 Frozen legacy | Owner-readable migration input only; customer writes retired |
| Trial/payment columns, filters, badges + drawer section in console | ✅ Shipped | Access status, trial remaining, trial dates; access filter |
| Vouchers tab (create / table / disable / usage + `voucher.*` audit) | ✅ Shipped | KPI cards, random code generator, validity dates, plan/frequency scoping; disable instead of delete |

| Checkout `/checkout` + pending page `/payment-pending` | ✅ Shipped | Three packages, monthly/annual billing, metadata-only manual requests; no gateway |
| Voucher codes at checkout (`voucher_codes` / `voucher_redemptions`) | ✅ Shipped | Percentage discount under Billing frequency; rules recompute the price server-side (`hasValidPaymentRequestVoucher`); race-safe redemption transaction |
| Legacy `payment.html` | 🧊 Redirect | Routes to `/pricing`; proof-upload controller retired |
| Trusted verification transition | 📋 Manual | Firebase Console for MVP; provider webhook/Admin SDK is the production path |
| Server-side trial enforcement + per-feature usage counters | 📋 Planned | Hard enforcement (30 tx / 10 bills / 5 subs / 10 AI msgs / 3 uploads) needs backend/Cloud Functions |
| Customer-facing route-level access gates (suspended screens, etc.) | 📋 Planned | Phase 3 |
| Real admin auth (Firebase custom claims / backend session) | 📋 Planned | Phase 5; replaces the temporary credential gate |

| **Browser-native PDF save (`window.print()`)** | ✅ Shipped MVP | App cannot verify save, so never logs `downloaded: true` |
| **`report_exports` metadata collection** | ✅ Shipped MVP | Append-only, user-scoped, no row-level data |
| **Period Comparison (vs previous period)** | ✅ Shipped MVP | Falls back to "Unavailable" when previous period has no records |

| Period filter (default current month) | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Uses shared `FluxyDateRangePicker` |

Preview only — not posted/closed |
| Accounting Records drilldown (`/accounting-records`) | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Auth-guarded read-only subpage with summary cards, suggested action, search/filter/sort, table pagination, and supporting Bills/Subscriptions context via `getIncomeStatementRelatedRecords` |
| Report confidence banner + KPI strip | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Readiness reused as supporting "report confidence" metadata (score/band/cleanup count), no longer the main experience |
| Cleanup queue (receipts, due dates, invoices, renewals, unmapped, bank review) | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Built from real user-scoped records |
| Account mapping preview + save flow | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Saved mappings win over suggestions; writes `users/{uid}/accounting_mappings` + audit log |
| Tabs: Income Statement / Cleanup / Account Mapping / Close | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Income Statement replaced the readiness-first Overview tab |
| Close readiness checklist | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Read-only; "Close period" is a disabled Planned control |
| AI assistant panel (suggested prompts) | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Opens existing Fluxy AI drawer; no autonomous writes |
| `accounting_mappings` collection + firestore.rules | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Enums/strings only; must be **deployed** before save works |

| Posted journal-entry income statement (P&L) | 📋 Planned | The shipped Income Statement is a preview; posted statements wait on journal posting + close |
| Period close + lock + `accounting_periods` | 📋 Planned | Needs confirmation, locking, and audit flow |

| Accounting export package | 📋 Planned | Topbar "Export package" disabled until shipped |

### Tax Center (Indonesia)
Full spec: `docs/INDONESIA_TAX_CENTER_ARCHITECTURE.md`. Derived from the Accounting
Kernel — tax posts as extra journal lines, never a parallel ledger. New sidebar group
**"Tax & Compliance"** → `/tax-center`. All collections workspace-scoped (§4o).

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Tax Center app page (`/tax-center`) + sidebar group | ✅ Shipped Phase 1 | Overview / Company Tax Profile / PPN / Withholding / Mappings tabs; "Tax & Compliance" sidebar group; `tax.read`-gated; deployed |

| Withholding — customers withhold on invoices (→ `1150`) | ✅ Shipped Phase 2 | Per-invoice customer-withholding; `markInvoicePaid` reclasses Dr 1150 / Cr Cash |
| Tax periods compute + file/lock (`tax_periods`) | ✅ Shipped Phase 3 | Overview period card; compute from ledger; file locks recompute; audited |
| SPT PPN + Bukti Potong CSV exports | ✅ Shipped Phase 3 | Period-scoped CSV downloads from PPN/Withholding tabs; `export.create` audit |
| Tax filings (`tax_filings`) | ✅ Shipped Phase 3 | SPT type + DJP reference + status recorded on file; Filings list; `tax_filing.submit` audit |

Read-only — never writes or files |
| DJP / Coretax / e-Faktur / e-Bupot integration | 📋 Planned | Phase 5.2; **blocked on real DJP API access/credentials** — data model seams ready; server-side in FastAPI backend |
| Tax Calendar + deadline reminders | 📋 Planned | Deadline reminders (PPN 20th, etc.); reconciliation checks now partially covered by the Phase 5.1 insights |

### Integrations
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Integrations grid UI | ✅ Shipped | Cards for BCA, Meta Ads, Stripe, etc. |
| Connect integration | 🔧 Stub | "Connect" button per card, no OAuth handler |

### Dashboard Sidebar Future Domains
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Overview | ✅ Shipped | Dashboard command center at `/dashboard` |
| Fluxy AI sidebar action | ✅ Shipped | Opens the AI drawer; not a route |
| Transactions / Ledger | ✅ Shipped | Working app page at `/ledger` |
| Bills | ✅ Shipped | Working app page at `/bill` |
| Subscriptions | ✅ Shipped | Working app page at `/subscription` |
| Integrations | ✅ Shipped | Working app page at `/integration` |

| Vendor Spend | 📋 Planned | Visible as disabled `Soon`; no app page yet |
| Receipt Capture | 📋 Planned | Visible as disabled `Soon`; no app page yet |
| Budgets | ✅ Shipped Phase 2 | `/budget` — Main Budget page for annual envelopes, planned-into-periods progress, and clickable period budgets. `/budget-period` owns allocation/sub-budget management, excluded records, and budget activity. `/budget-allocation` is the allocation drill-in. Ledger and Bills still show budget chips with Assign / Restore actions, and every manual change writes a `budget_assignment.*` audit log. Approvals, hard enforcement, Pay Now, and AI auto-assign remain Phase 3. |
| Invoices | ✅ Shipped MVP | `/invoices` — Operations entry directly under Budgets. See "Invoices" section below. |
| Approvals | 📋 Planned | Visible as disabled `Soon`; no app page yet |
| Reports & Exports | ✅ Shipped MVP | `/reports` — period filter, readiness score, preview drawer, CSV export, `export.create` audit log |
| Audit Log | 📋 Planned | Visible as disabled `Soon`; no app page yet |
| Settings | ✅ Shipped MVP | Working app page at `/settings` with company, finance, import, WhatsApp, AI, and account basics |

Visible `Soon` entries communicate product direction only. They must stay
disabled until a real authenticated app page and data contract exist.

### Invoices (Operations)
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Invoices app page (`/invoices`) | ✅ Shipped MVP | Auth-guarded, sidebar entry under Operations directly below Budgets, no marketing footer |
| Invoice list (summary cards, search, status filter, pagination) | ✅ Shipped MVP | Open / Drafts / Amount due / Paid this month cards; Overdue is display-only (`open` + past due + amount due > 0) |
| Create/edit workspace (split form + live preview) | ✅ Shipped MVP | Stripe-benchmarked workflow, FluxyOS-native UI; preview hidden behind Show preview on mobile |
| Draft save (`users/{uid}/invoices` + `items` subcollection) | ✅ Shipped MVP | Raw integer amounts; invoice + items + audit log committed in one `writeBatch` |
| Review modal → Finalize only / Finalize and mark as sent | ✅ Shipped MVP | Finalize requires customer, due date, ≥1 item, total > 0; mark-as-sent additionally requires customer email |
| Void with required reason (`invoice.voided` audit) | ✅ Shipped MVP | Delete is blocked in UI and Firestore rules |
| Invoice CSV export (raw integers, `export.create` audit) | ✅ Shipped MVP | |
| Per-user invoice numbers `INV-YYYYMM-0001` | ✅ Shipped MVP | Derived from latest existing number; no global counters |
| Ledger transaction from finalization | 🚫 By design | A finalized invoice is an expected receivable only — it never auto-creates revenue |
| Payment collection / gateway / payment page | 📋 Planned | `payment_collection_method` stored; no provider integration |
| Send by email (Gmail-compose handoff) | ✅ Shipped MVP | Detail-view action on open invoices with a customer email; `target="_blank"` anchor opens mail.google.com compose in a new tab pre-filled with recipient/subject/summary (no iframe — CSP frame-src safe). FluxyOS sends nothing itself |
| PDF preview + Download PDF (browser print) | ✅ Shipped MVP | Detail-view modal renders the invoice document; Download opens the print dialog scoped to the document (Save as PDF). No backend generation; app never logs `downloaded: true` |
| PDF generation + invoice email delivery (provider-backed) | 📋 Planned | Mark-as-sent is a manual status stamp only in v1 |
| Mark as paid + ledger reconciliation | 📋 Planned | `paid` status reserved; client writes of `paid_at` are blocked by rules |
| Recurring invoices, multi-currency, customer database, discounts | 📋 Planned | Currency locked to IDR in v1; `discount_amount` stored as 0 |

---
